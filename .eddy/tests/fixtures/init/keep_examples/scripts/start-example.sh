# Runs at the end of `.devtools/start` (after the PHP webserver is up and
# serving). The current working directory is the project root. Any non-zero
# exit aborts the parent start run.

# Drop your own logic in any file matching `scripts/start-*.sh` - all
# matching files run in lexicographic order. Use this for server-lifecycle
# tasks such as launching an access tunnel or a file watcher.
